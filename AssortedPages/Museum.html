              <p>The birth of Dylan Notes. Unlike all the other versions, this one was made with Wix. The yellow and black color scheme was due to the Wix template I used. Using this version was fun and easy for a little, but it left me feeling like I cheated, because I wanted to learn HTML.</p>

            <p>The first Dylan Notes coded by me. I first learned to code in HTML from a tutorial on YouTube, and this was my first ever project. The Wix site was still up, hence the "Experimental Version" in the title. It would later be named "Dylan Notes 2". This style would remain in place for the rest of eighth grade.</p>

            <p>The first major revision. It ditched the metallic background image, Impact font, and the old logo. It was also the first version to include animations and a real navbar. But, under the hood, the HTML was mostly the same. I made this version at camp, working on it over the summer until version 3.5.0. This design would remain in place until version 5.0.0.</p>

            <p>And just like that, they're gone. The Moriah notes were officially removed in this version, at the request of the administrators. Dylan Notes was so popular among Moriah 8th Graders in 2017, that they were using my notes over theirs. Additionally, in this version you can see the rare green Dylan Notes logo, used for the "Dylan Notes Community Edition". Nobody ever used that.</p>

            <p>Wow. Not only did this version come with a <i>complete</i> rewriting of all of the code, it also came with the first usage of the new domain, dylannotes.com. It's got it all: a snazzy background, a cool, new color palette, new name, and it uses bootstrap! It also has links to the notes pages on the home page, in the form of cool polygons with text on them. You can't see it here, but this version actually had an ugly, centered picture of the word "9th" to take you to the 9th grade notes. This was also the first appearance of the "Easter Egg" Page, accessed by clicking on the version at the bottom of the page.</p>

            <p>The current version of Dylan Notes. It's taken over four years to get to this point, and I'm proud of the journey that this site has taken. It's had facelift after facelift, and I think the current design will take it through the end of Frisch. Thank you for coming along.</p>
